## CFOP Algorithms

This projects outlines algorithms used in solving the rubik's cube using the CFOP method

### Available algorithms are

1. First two layers
2. Orientation of the last layer
3. Permutation of the last layer

### A symmetrical approach

All the algorithms were combined with a symmetrical acknowledgement of the rubik's<br/>
cube and are not necessarily the most efficient solutions.
