This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## CFOP Algorithms

This projects outlines algorithms used in solving the rubik's cube using the CFOP method

### Available alorothms are

1. First two layers
2. Orientation of the last layer
3. Permutaton of the last layer

### A symmetrical approach

All the algorithms were combined with a symmetrical acknowledgement of the rubik's<br/>
cube and are not necessarily the most efficient solutions.
